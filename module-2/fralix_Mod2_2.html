        <h2>Chapter 1: Brief Introduction of Myself</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            I was born and raised in a small town that has a tight-knit community. 
            Growing up, I loved exploring the outdoors and spending time with friends. 
            <span class="sentence"My favorite hobbies are watching Doctor Who and visiting the Disney Parks to people watch.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            My family has always been very supportive of my goals and ambitions. 
            We often enjoy weekend trips together and spend quality time talking about our week. 
            I also have two younger siblings who share many of my interests, which makes our bond even stronger.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my free time, I enjoy spending time with my kids and wife and staying active. 
            Riding bike and swimming are my favorites, but I also like trying new activities. 
            Being physically active helps me maintain focus and energy for my studies.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have always been passionate about technology and learning new skills. 
            Experimenting with coding and web design has become a hobby that I find both challenging and rewarding. 
            I look forward to applying these skills to future projects and career opportunities.
